# ABOUT ME

## WHO AM I?

Hey there! I'm a **passionate developer** who loves creating digital experiences that make people go "WOW!" ðŸš€

I'm obsessed with clean code, brutal design, and making the web a more interesting place. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or probably drinking way too much coffee.

### WHAT I DO

- **Frontend Development**: Creating stunning user interfaces with modern frameworks
- **Backend Development**: Building robust APIs and server-side applications  
- **UI/UX Design**: Crafting user experiences that don't suck
- **Open Source**: Contributing to the community and sharing knowledge

### PHILOSOPHY

> "Code is poetry written for machines but read by humans."

I believe in:
- **Simplicity over complexity**
- **Function over form** (but why not both?)
- **Continuous learning**
- **Sharing knowledge**
- **Building things that matter**

### FUN FACTS

- I've written over **100,000 lines** of code (and deleted probably twice as many)
- I can debug CSS for hours and somehow enjoy it
- My rubber duck debugging collection has **12 ducks**
- I once spent 3 hours fixing a bug that was caused by a missing semicolon
- I think `vim` vs `emacs` debates are silly (VS Code gang! ðŸ˜Ž)
